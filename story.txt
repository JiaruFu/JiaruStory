	In a small town in northern Norway, there lived a man named Martin. Almost in his 40s, he was still so sure that he would never find a woman in his life. He loved to watch his couple neighbors having fun in their gardens and with their children. Sometimes, when they came back from a long family trip, they would bring little gifts for him. But overall, compared to other people, Martin was the weirdest guy ever. He loved how he lived until one day a mysterious stranger came to this town and totally changed his life.. 
	This mysterious stranger gave Martin a magic power that turns him into a very handsome man. Martin was very excited. He believed one reason why he couldn't find a girl is because of his appearance. Now everything had changed, he was eager to go out and hang out with some girls.
	He made up his mind, going straight to a hub and meeting with some beauties. ¡°Hi, Martin, you look so handsome!¡± A girl waving at him, ¡°Would you like to dance with me?¡± ¡°Sure!¡± Martin smiled and danced with her. ¡°What a wonderful day! It is my first time to dance with such a beautiful girl!¡± Martin thought.
